## Hi, I'm Paolo 👋

I'm an AI/ML practitioner with a bias towards action than perfectionism. I am based in 🇵🇭 where it's mostly 🌤️ or 🌧️. I play sports and take pictures in my free time.

- 🎓 I am currently studying Artificial Intelligence (MEng AI) in the graudate level, part-time at UP Diliman.
- ⛴️ I have worked with a supply chain tech startup in US, where I was involved in building and experimenting with doc AI solutions for the global trade.
- 📡 I have worked with a telco company in PH, where I was involved in delivering a wide plethora of tabular and geospatial ML problems in the telco space.
