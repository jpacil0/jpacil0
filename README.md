## Hi, I'm Paolo 👋

I'm an AI/ML practitioner with a bias towards action than blind perfectionism. I am based in 🇵🇭 where it's mostly 🌤️ or 🌧️. Outside development work, I play sports 🎾 and take pictures 📸 in my free time. I'm best reached via [email](joshuaacilo.13@gmail.com) for anything interesting.

- 🎓 I am part of the pioneer batch of the AI program at UP Diliman, where I am currently studying MEng in Artificial Intelligence.
- ⛴️ I have worked with a supply chain tech startup in US, where I was involved in building and experimenting with doc AI solutions for the global trade.
- 📡 I have worked with a telco company in PH, where I was involved in delivering a wide plethora of tabular and geospatial ML problems in the telco space.
