## Hi, I'm Paolo 👋

I am an AI/ML practitioner with a bias towards action than blind perfectionism. I am based in 🇵🇭 where it's mostly 🌤️ or 🌧️. Outside development work, I play sports 🎾 and take pictures 📸 in my free time. I am best reached via [email](joshuaacilo.13@gmail.com) for anything interesting.

- 🎓 I am part of the pioneer batch of the AI program in the Philippines at UP Diliman, where I am currently studying MEng in AI
- ⛴️ I worked with a tech startup in US before, where I was training docAI models for processing paperworks in the global trade
- 📡 I worked with a telco company in PH before, where I was doing mostly tabular ML and where we kickstarted geospatial DS
